# Prostats

Prostats is a Counter Strike Global Offesnive stat tracking web app. It's comprised of two server, the stat server which takes in CS:GO demo files and parses them into a Postgres database and the front server which pulls from the database and displays all of the statistics.

Requires refactoring.
